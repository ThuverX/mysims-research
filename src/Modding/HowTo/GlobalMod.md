# Creating a global mod (Controller)
**NOTE:** This approach requires you to make use of the [MySims ModLoader](https://github.com/ThuverX/MySimsModLoader/wiki/How-to-make-mods#32-lua-hook). 
Make sure you've set that up first before proceeding! 

From this point on, the term "global mod" will be now considered a "Controller" as that's what Maxis has done as well.

## Intro
In this tutorial we're going to be exploring how to make a controller for My Sims. A controller is exactly what it says on the tin: It's a script that exists in the world and is not connected to any interactions or characters.

### When should I consider making a Global Mod?
When you...
- Find yourself making a "Manager". (i.e, a script that needs to keep up with things happening in the world and therefore cannot be connected to an interaction. Think: A weather mod).
- Find yourself in a situation where data needs to either be transfered from one world to another.
- Need something global that keeps track of multiple Game Objects and manipulate said data. (See: Controller_Tag)

Obviously these are just some case scenarios that you might need it. If your scenario isn't here that may not necessarily mean it's a terrible idea to make a controller for it!

## Getting started
First things first, we start with a bare basic setup. In this tutorial I'll go a bit more in depth as what certain approaches for your controller could be a good idea.

```lua

if Player then
    -- Make sure to replace everything starting with "MyController" with your controller name!!
    Hooks:PostHook(Player, "PatchTaskInventory", "MyController__Player:PatchTaskInventory", function(self)
       
        -- first grab any existing global controllers, before considering making a new one...
        -- @param `Controller_MyController` make sure that this is the name of your class variable (See section: Controller_MyController = ControllerBase:Inherit( "Controller_MyController" ))
        local myController = GetGlobalScriptObject("Controller_MyController") 

        -- if this is the first time loading it, load it in!
        if myController == nil then
            myController = SpawnObject( "Controller_MyController", "ObjectDefs/Controller_MyController_Def.xml", ObjectTypes.eGlobalScript, 0, 0, 0, 0, GetGlobalScriptsWorld())	
        end 
    end)
end

-- We also check if ControllerBase has been loaded in yet! Otherwise you'll get errors.
if ControllerBase then
    -- Make sure that the variable is global and is the same as the string param for `GetGlobalScriptObject()` and `SpawnObject()`
    Controller_MyController = ControllerBase:Inherit( "Controller_MyController" )
end

```

#### Why hook into the player?
Controllers are technically also GameObject, but "Empty" ones (aka, they have no mesh/skin/textures). This is completely normal in games, as it initially means a world has an instance that keeps all the information you'd like to keep, in an object! Think of it as an invisible moving box you're constantly adding things to.

However, *because* we need it to become a 'game object', it does mean we need to load it in. And what better way than seeing if the player has been instantiated to load in our controller as well! That way we also have the guarantee that everything in the world has been loaded, as the player seems to be loaded last.

### Setting up the controller class
Now that we have a class set up and ready to do things, we now will be looking at how to get a simple controller up and running! Keep in mind that from here on the code is going to feel very "Object-oriented". So if you have some experience in C# or the like, you might recognise some patterns here.  

Let's take a closer look at our `Controller_MyController` class we inherited...

First things first, for it to even "exist" we need to add two more functions:

```lua

if ControllerBase then
    Controller_MyController = ControllerBase:Inherit( "Controller_MyController" )

    -- Base variables. Just like in object oriented languages, these are variables you want to use all across but defaulting to nil or setting them to a default interger for example.
    function Controller_MyController:Constructor()
      self.
    end

    -- Where the magic happens! This is where our code is executed!
    function Controller_MyController:Run()
    end

end
```

And ironically that's all we need! Except, that for the player, we don't even know our controller "exists" now. So what better way than demonstrating it with a message box... Your code should now look something like this:

```lua
if Player then
    -- Make sure to replace everything starting with "MyController" with your controller name!!
    Hooks:PostHook(Player, "PatchTaskInventory", "MyController__Player:PatchTaskInventory", function(self)
       
        -- first grab any existing global controllers, before considering making a new one...
        -- @param `Controller_MyController` make sure that this is the name of your class variable (See section: Controller_MyController = ControllerBase:Inherit( "Controller_MyController" ))
        local myController = GetGlobalScriptObject("Controller_MyController") 

        -- if this is the first time loading it, load it in!
        if myController == nil then
            myController = SpawnObject( "Controller_MyController", "ObjectDefs/Controller_MyController_Def.xml", ObjectTypes.eGlobalScript, 0, 0, 0, 0, GetGlobalScriptsWorld())	
        end 
    end)
end


if ControllerBase then
    Controller_MyController = ControllerBase:Inherit( "Controller_MyController" )

    -- Base variables. Just like in object oriented languages, these are variables you want to use all across but defaulting to nil or setting them to a default interger for example.
    function Controller_MyController:Constructor()
      self.greetingText = "Hello there! I am a controller!"
    end

    -- Where the magic happens! This is where our code is executed!
    function Controller_MyController:Run()
      DisplayMessage("My Controller Header", self.greetingText)
    end

end
```

### Making the Game Recognize Your Object

Now that we've finished the coding portion, we need to let the game know how to actually spawn your new item. Notice this line in your code:

```lua
myController = SpawnObject( "Controller_MyController", "ObjectDefs/Controller_MyController_Def.xml", ObjectTypes.eGlobalScript, 0, 0, 0, 0, GetGlobalScriptsWorld())
```

The argument `"ObjectDefs/Controller_MyController_Def.xml"` tells the game to look for an XML definition file in the `ObjectDefs` folder, located at: `...\MySims\SimsRevData\GameData\ObjectDefs` *(`...` represents the preceding path to your MySims installation.)*

To add your own definition file, open that `ObjectDefs` folder and create a new text document, like so: `Right-click > New > Text Document`

Although the name isnâ€™t strictly important, itâ€™s best to keep it consistent. For example, call it `Controller_MyController_Def`, then replace the `.txt` extension with `.xml`. This ensures the game will recognize and load your custom object definition. 

Now, we open up the text file and feel free to copy paste this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ObjectDef>
  <Script>Controller_MyController</Script> <!-- ADD YOUR CONTROLLER CLASS NAME HERE~!! -->
</ObjectDef>
```

And voila! Now We test it in game and see if it works! ðŸ˜‰ If we did this correctly, once you load your game, we should see a message box that pops up saying "Hello there! I am a controller!". 

## A few things to note about controllers:
Most of these things we will tackle in the next section, but in case you need a quick heads up:

- Controllers only run once by default.
- Controllers don't by default have Class Constructors (not to be confused with `constructor()` function. That's different. See **"Using a Constructor-like way to set up our controller"** below.)
- Controllers don't save your variable data by default, after save & Quitting the game.
- You can set up a controller through an interaction call. (See "How to destroy my controller", so you don't end up with a billion controllers in one world.)
- Controllers don't 'survive' going from one "world" to another (Think: MyTown to the Forest world).
- 

## The Advanced stuff
Now that you know how to set up a basic Controller, there are plenty of other creative ways to expand its functionality. While this guide doesnâ€™t cover every possibility, make sure to review the global files for additional referencesâ€”especially the files in the `controller` folder, located under the `Lua` folder in `SimsRevData\GameData`. This will help you get a better sense of all the global functions and features available for your custom Controller scripts.


### Grabbing your controller inside an interaction.
Sometimes, we need to grab some data from inside an interaction or a place outside of our controller class. To ensure we have the correct data to, let's say, display to the player.

Let's say, instead of displaying our message inside of the controller's `run()` function, we instead do it in the interaction, we may want to do something like:

```lua
            local myController = GetGlobalScriptObject("Controller_MyController") -- Since our controller already exists, we grab it from the existing world global script list.
            if myController ~= nil then
                DisplayMessage("My Controller Title", myController.greetingText)
            end
```

Or, let's say, in case of running a function instead, we could do this:

```lua
            local myController = GetGlobalScriptObject("Controller_MyController") -- Since our controller already exists, we grab it from the existing world global script list.
            if myController ~= nil then
                DisplayMessage("My Controller Title", myController:FunctionHere()) -- Of course we can also parse in a parameter like you'd usually! But this isn't shown in the example
            end
```

### Using a Constructor-like way to set up our controller
Sometimes a controller needs a constructor-like approach to set up the variables, similar to when we instantiate a class with a constructor through C#. Often this is done after the controller object has been properly created.

The setup inside of our controller would look something like this...

```lua

    Controller_MyController = ControllerBase:Inherit( "Controller_MyController" )

    function Controller_MyController:Constructor()
      self.greetingText = nil
      self.player = nil
    end

    function Controller_Mycontroller:Setup(greeting, player)
      self.greetingText = greeting
      self.player = player
    end

    function Controller_MyController:Run()
      DisplayMessage("My Controller Header", self.greetingText)
    end

```

and then once we create our object, you may do something like this:

```lua
        local myController = SpawnObject( "Controller_MyController", "ObjectDefs/Controller_MyController_Def.xml", ObjectTypes.eGlobalScript, 0, 0, 0, 0, GetGlobalScriptsWorld())	
        if (myController ~= nil) then
            local text = "I am a greeting! Salutations!"
            local player = GetPlayerGameObject()

            -- for good measure, you never know if an NPC accidentally calls our function!
            if player ~= nil and greetingText ~= "" then
              controller:Setup(text, sim)
            end

        end
```

after your `setup()` function has been called, the `Run()` should be called automatically by the game!

### Calling Run() Multiple times
While most of the time your controller may do very straightforward things, we do have cases where we want it to, let's say, run multiple times for a f
