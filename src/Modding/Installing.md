# Installation

1. Go to the latest [Release](https://github.com/ThuverX/MySimsModLoader/releases)
2. Download the file `windows-x86`
3. Unzip it into your game folder, next to `MySims.exe` (`MySims/bin/`)
    - In the end you should have `mods`, `dsound.dll` and `MySims.exe` in the same folder.
4. Done! Launch the game like normal.

# Uninstallation
1. Remove `dsound.dll`
2. Optionally remove the `mods` folder

# Installing mods

- Once you have found a mod that you like, unzip its folder into the `mods` folder.
    - If it looks like `mods/MOD NAME/mod.xml` you've done it correctly!.

To uninstall simply remove that folder from the `mods`.
