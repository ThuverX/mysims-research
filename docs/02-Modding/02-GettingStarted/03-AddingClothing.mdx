# Adding new clothing

> ⚠️ this currently only works in the Cozy Bundle version of the game.

> ⚠️ this tweaker is still in development, only `Body` clothing has been tested so far.

Adding new clothing is easy with the new clothing tweaker. Start by adding a file ending in `.outfit.xml` to your `assets` folder. And for now lets start with this template:
```xml
<Outfit
	type="Body"
	category="kBodyCasual"
	gender="U"
	texture="shirt_tex"
	mask="shirt_mask">
	<Name>shirt</Name>
	<Model>afBodyMini</Model>
	<Contexts>
		<Context>kMaster</Context>
		<Context>kInitial</Context>
		<Context>kUpdateHead</Context>
		<Context>kUpdateBody</Context>
	</Contexts>
</Outfit>
```

This xml contains all info required to add new clothing, except for the `texture` and `mask` textures, that you'll need to provide yourself.

## Parts

### Type
Can either be `Body`, `Head`, `Eyes`, `Mouth` or `Accessory`. This tells the tweaker where to apply the new textures.

### Category
Depends on the type, can be:
- `kBodyProfessional`, `kBodyCasual` for `Body`
- `kHeadStandard`, `kHeadHat`, `kHeadHatNoHair`, `kHeadBald`, `kHeadBaldNoHair` for `Head`
- `kEyesNormal` for `Eyes`
- `kMouthNormal` for `Mouth`
- `kAccessoryGlasses` for `Accessory`

### Gender
Can be `F`, `M` or `U`. For `Female`, `Male` or `Universal`. I suggest keeping this on `U` to let players wear anything!

### Texture
The name of texture for this clothing piece without the `.dds`. Here's an example for the above XML:

<img alt="shirt_tex" src={useBaseUrl(`/img/shirt_tex.png`)} height="512" />
*(Amazing I know)*


### Mask
The name of the texture for the skin mask (without the `.dds`), this is a system introduced in Cozy Bundle allowing any skin color on any clothing item.

<img alt="shirt_mask" src={useBaseUrl(`/img/shirt_mask.png`)} height="512" />

The darkness of a pixel determines shadow on the skin, while transparency means that there is no skin here.

### Model
One of a list of body models (Or a custom model) on which to apply this clothing material.

### Name
The internal name for this clothing piece, only used programmatically. Important to give it a unique name.

### Contexts
Determines in what wardrobe / Create a Sim this clothing item appears in. Either `kMaster`, `kInitial`, `kUpdateHead`, `kUpdateBody`, `kSalon`, `kSalonNPC`, `kBoutique`, `kCostume`, `kCostumeNPC` or `kPreSell`.
