**Always make sure when updating MSML, you also update the basemod (by replacing the old one)**


## Uninstallation
1. Remove `dsound.dll` or `WSOCK32.dll`
2. Optionally remove the `mods` folder


## Installing mods
Mods for MSML are just folder you can place into the `mods` folder, Once you have found a mod that you like, unzip its folder into the `mods` folder.

(*If it looks like `mods/MOD NAME/mod.xml` you've done it correctly!*)

To uninstall simply remove that folder from the `mods`.
