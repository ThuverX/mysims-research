# Save

Holds your save game information, a [zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) compressed list of files.
Use [this tool](https://thuverx.github.io/MySimsSaveConverterOnline/) to edit your save files.

## Location

- Cozy bundle save files are found in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Electronic Arts/MySims`
- MySims (2010) save **folders** are found in `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Electronic Arts/MySims`

Both versions contain the same information, Cozy Bundle just compressed them to files so they can easily be stored on services like [Steam Cloud](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/68D2-35AB-09A9-7678).
