# clip

Clip files are just Granny3d files, so far I've only seen use of the Animation tracks. Clips need to use Granny3d's proprietary tools "granny2.dll" to extract / modify / create since they are oodle2 compressed. So its either use proprietary oodle2 to decompress or use proprietary granny2 to modify. Pick your poison :P
